# Cloud Hosted Jupyter Notebooks
In this repository, I have demonstrated the capability to use jupyter notebooks on Google Colab and link them to a Github Repository. This notebook is an example of an assignment from a data science course which reads csv data and executes several plotting manipulations similar to exploratory data analysis. This specific notebook is not relevant but the concept of having a hosted notebook which uses external resources is huge. Additionally, Google Drive can be mounted onto Colab for added sharability and asynchronous workflow.
